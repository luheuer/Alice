# Alice
 My Submission for Intro to Unity.
 In This little project, which is more of a proof of Concept, I tried to adapt the classis "Alice in Wonderland" into a puzzle-platformer.
 We start of with not much platforming to be done, as we find our way through a maze.
 But soon Alice and by extension the Player finds themselves in the strange Wonderland in which nothing is as it seems.
 Grow and shrink by picking up different Items and find your Way through the somtimes deceiving parkour.

 Controls:
 In Top down view:
 - W/S to move Up/Down
 - A/D to move Left/Right

 In Side view:
 - A/D to move Left/Right
 - Spacebar to jump
 - hold 'r' to reset to the last spawn point

 In some places of the Code there are still traces of some things that didn't quite make it in due to time constraints (I am currently typing this past the due date, so I hope this will even be considered).
 The Time was my biggest issue at the end, otherwise I would have added at least one other level, where the player meets the Cheshire Cat and has to help it find its bodyparts in the forest. A fun feature of this Level would have been bouncy mushrooms, which catapult the player into the air.
